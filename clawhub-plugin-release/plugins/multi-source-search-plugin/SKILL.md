# Multi Source Search Plugin

This root manifest mirrors the packaged skill runtime so ClawHub registry scans can read the same requirements declared in the native plugin manifests.

- Packaged skill: `skills/multi-source-search/`
- Native manifest: `openclaw.plugin.json`
- Claude-compatible fallback: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
