# AIsa YouTube Search

Search YouTube videos, channels, and playlists through the AIsa YouTube relay with one API key.

## When to use

- The user wants to search YouTube videos, channels, or playlists.
- The task needs region or language filters without direct Google API setup.
- The workflow can call the AIsa YouTube search endpoint with `AISA_API_KEY`.

## When NOT to use

- The user needs browser automation, local scraping, or direct YouTube account actions.
- The workflow must avoid sending search requests to `api.aisa.one`.
- The request depends on a local helper script that is not part of this package.

## Quick Reference

- Required environment variable: `AISA_API_KEY`
- Endpoint: `https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/youtube/search`
- This package is curl-first and does not ship a local Python client.

## Setup

```bash
export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Common Commands

```bash
curl -s "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/youtube/search?engine=youtube&q=machine+learning+tutorial" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"

curl -s "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/youtube/search?engine=youtube&q=AI+news&gl=us&hl=en" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"

curl -s "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v1/youtube/search?engine=youtube&q=python+tutorial&sp=EgIQAQ%3D%3D" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISA_API_KEY"
```

## Capabilities

- Search YouTube SERP results with `q`
- Filter by locale with `gl` and `hl`
- Apply pagination or narrowing via `sp`
- Return structured results that may include `videos` or grouped `sections`

## Guardrails

- Do not ask for Google credentials or browser cookies.
- Do not claim a result is local-only when it depends on relay requests.
- Do not fabricate missing filters or parameters.

## Security Notes

- All search requests go to `api.aisa.one`.
- Required secret: `AISA_API_KEY`.
- This workflow does not require passwords, browser automation, or local scraping.
