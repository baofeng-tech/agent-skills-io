# AIsa Provider

Release-ready Claude Code skill package generated from `targetSkills/aisa-provider`.

- Skill name: `aisa-provider`
- Entry point: `SKILL.md`
- Runtime assets: `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` when present

## Notes

- Configure AIsa as a first-class model provider for OpenClaw, enabling production access to major Chinese AI models (Qwen, DeepSeek, Kimi K2.5, Doubao) through official partnerships with Alibaba Cloud, BytePlus, and Moonshot. Use this skill when the user wants to set up Chinese AI models, configure AIsa API access, compare pricing between AIsa and other providers (OpenRouter, Bailian), switch between Qwen/DeepSeek/Kimi models, or troubleshoot AIsa provider configuration in OpenClaw. Also use when the user mentions AISA_API_KEY, asks about Chinese LLM pricing, Kimi K2.5 setup, or needs help with Qwen Key Account setup.
- This README is release-specific and replaces source READMEs that were written for other runtimes.
- If the underlying instructions mention OpenClaw, treat that as source-context or compatibility guidance unless the skill is specifically about OpenClaw setup.

## Quick Start

1. Open `SKILL.md` to review invocation guidance and runtime requirements.
2. Set any required environment variables before running bundled scripts.
3. Use repo-relative paths like `python3 scripts/...` when following command examples.
