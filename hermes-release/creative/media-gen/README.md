# Media Gen

Release-ready Hermes skill package generated from `targetSkills/media-gen`.

- Skill name: `media-gen`
- Entry point: `SKILL.md`
- Runtime assets: `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` when present

## Notes

- Generate images and videos with AIsa. Four image models (Google Gemini 3 Pro Image, Alibaba Wan 2.7 image + image-pro, ByteDance Seedream) and four Wan video variants (wan2.6/2.7 × t2v/i2v). One API key; the client routes each model to the correct endpoint automatically. Use when: the user needs AI image or video generation workflows.
- This README is release-specific and replaces source READMEs that were written for other runtimes.
- If the underlying instructions mention OpenClaw, treat that as source-context or compatibility guidance unless the skill is specifically about OpenClaw setup.

## Quick Start

1. Open `SKILL.md` to review invocation guidance and runtime requirements.
2. Set any required environment variables before running bundled scripts.
3. Use repo-relative paths like `python3 scripts/...` when following command examples.
