# seo-keyword-research

Use this skill when a user asks for SEO keyword research, keyword discovery, search volume analysis, keyword difficulty, search intent mapping, topic clusters, content opportunities, competitor keyword gaps, or a keyword strategy for a domain, URL, product, market, or seed topic. When a website is provided, crawl and interpret the site first, then use AIsa API access to DataForSEO keyword, SERP, trend, Labs, and OnPage endpoints plus AIsa LLM reasoning to find non-brand keyword opportunities. Use when: the user needs web search, research, source discovery, or content extraction.

## When to Use

- Use this release when the user needs the runtime packaged under `scripts/`.
- Prefer the bundled Python or shell entrypoints instead of copying raw API examples into the chat.
- For Hermes community installs, keep setup explicit and review the command help text before the first run.

## Setup

- Review `README.md` for the release-specific summary and structure.
- Use repo-relative paths under `scripts/`.
- Prefer explicit CLI auth flags such as `--api-key` or `--aisa-api-key` when a script exposes them.

## Quick Reference

- `python3 scripts/aisa_client.py --help`
- `python3 scripts/site_crawler.py --help`

## Verification

- Confirm the command returns structured output or a successful API response.
- If the workflow stores local state, verify it writes under a repo-local data directory rather than a home-directory default.
