# stock-analysis

Analyze stocks and cryptocurrencies with 8-dimension scoring via AIsa API. Provides BUY/HOLD/SELL signals with confidence levels, entry/target/stop prices, and risk flags. Supports single or multi-ticker analysis with optional fast mode and JSON output. Use when the user asks to analyze a stock, check a ticker, or compare investments.

## When to Use

- Use this release when the user needs the runtime packaged under `scripts/`.
- Prefer the bundled Python or shell entrypoints instead of copying raw API examples into the chat.
- For Hermes community installs, keep setup explicit and review the command help text before the first run.

## Setup

- Review `README.md` for the release-specific summary and structure.
- Use repo-relative paths under `scripts/`.
- Prefer explicit CLI auth flags such as `--api-key` or `--aisa-api-key` when a script exposes them.

## Quick Reference

- `python3 scripts/analyze_stock.py --help`

## Verification

- Confirm the command returns structured output or a successful API response.
- If the workflow stores local state, verify it writes under a repo-local data directory rather than a home-directory default.
