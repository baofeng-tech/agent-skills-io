# twitter-command-center-search-post

Searches and reads X (Twitter): profiles, timelines, mentions, followers, tweet search, trends, lists, communities, and Spaces. Publishes posts after the user completes OAuth in the browser. Use when the user asks about Twitter/X data, social listening, or posting without sharing account passwords.

## When to Use

- Use this release when the user needs the runtime packaged under `scripts/`.
- Prefer the bundled Python or shell entrypoints instead of copying raw API examples into the chat.
- For Hermes community installs, keep setup explicit and review the command help text before the first run.

## Setup

- Review `README.md` for the release-specific summary and structure.
- Use repo-relative paths under `scripts/`.
- Prefer explicit CLI auth flags such as `--api-key` or `--aisa-api-key` when a script exposes them.

## Quick Reference

- `python3 scripts/twitter_client.py --help`
- `python3 scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py --help`

## Verification

- Confirm the command returns structured output or a successful API response.
- If the workflow stores local state, verify it writes under a repo-local data directory rather than a home-directory default.
