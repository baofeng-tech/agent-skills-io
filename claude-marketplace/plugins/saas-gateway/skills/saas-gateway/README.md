- This README is release-specific and replaces source READMEs that were written for other runtimes.
- If the underlying instructions mention OpenClaw, treat that as source-context or compatibility guidance unless the skill is specifically about OpenClaw setup.

## Quick Start

1. Open `SKILL.md` to review invocation guidance and runtime requirements.
2. Set any required environment variables before running bundled scripts.
3. Use repo-relative paths like `python3 scripts/...` when following command examples.
