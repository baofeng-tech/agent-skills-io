# AIsa ClawHub Breakout Editor

Refine ClawHub-oriented breakout copy and suspicious-remediation surfaces after the mother skill is already stable.

## When to use

- When preparing ClawHub-specific breakout variants
- When repairing `Suspicious` or trust-review issues for ClawHub skills or plugins
- When sharpening JTBD copy for ClawHub search or live-risk remediation without changing runtime behavior

## Core rules

- Start from a stable mother skill; do not use this profile as the default editor for `targetSkills/`.
- Keep the real auth story explicit: `AISA_API_KEY`, relay targets, OAuth approval, media upload, and external writes.
- Align `SKILL.md`, README, manifests, and registry-facing metadata.
- Use breakout positioning only when it matches the shipped runtime and sibling ladder.
- Keep ClawHub-only breakout slugs inside `targets/clawhub-breakout-variants.json` and generated ClawHub layers.
- Prefer the smallest safe change that removes trust drift or scanner confusion.
- Do not delete core runtime behavior just to make a package sound safer.

## Output expectations

- ClawHub copy may be sharper, more task-first, and more explicit about side effects than the mother skill.
- Suspicious remediation should reduce ambiguity, not widen scope.
- The result should stay compatible with the repo's generated ClawHub skill/plugin layers.
